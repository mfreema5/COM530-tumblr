Tumblr theme
=============

The branch [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/mfreema5/COM530-tumblr/tree/gh-pages) is the most current version of what's on [mjf-tawp.tumblr.com](http://mjf-tawp.tumblr.com/).

There's also the [`localhost`](https://github.com/mfreema5/COM530-tumblr/tree/localhost) branch, which I try to keep in sync with `gh-pages`, except that I point the CSS to a local file, and hard-code in content.
The point being that I can load the versions of files in branch `localhost` from a `localhost` and see something close enough to the tumblr version to work on it.
